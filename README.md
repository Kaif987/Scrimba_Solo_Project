# Scrimba Solo Project - Quiz App

This project is a solo project from Bob Ziroll's React tutorial in Scrimba.
I recommend checking out his tutorial [here](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact)
The figma design file can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/file/E9S5iPcm10f0RIHK8mCqKL/Quizzical-App?node-id=0%3A1)

This app pulls out questions from [Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php) and displays ten Question. The user has to answer all the questions and then press the submit button.
On pressing submit correct answers are highlighted in green and the incorrect are highlighted in red and also the score is displayed in the end.
